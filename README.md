# Final-Project

This repository contains my final project for my CMP 262 class. In this project. I am using a database of fishing vessel data to analyze trends in mass fishing efforts. This project aims to bring awareness of just how much fishing is being done out there on the high seas. This issue impacts all of us, as overfishing of our seas can lead to devastating effects on the environment and ecosystem. 

My project presents results from my dataset that plans to answer the following:
What countries are out there fishing? Are there countries that have a large share in global fishing efforts?
What types of fishing are going on? My dataset contains fishing vessel types, and I want to know what categories they fall into.
What is the percentage split of the amount of active hours vs the amount of fishing hours over this dataset?
What are the gross tonnage totals for each country's fishing fleet?
